I’ve successfully extracted and loaded the following files from your `Linuxworld_repo`:

* `Dockerfile`
* `README.md`
* `project1.py`
* `requirements.txt`
* `test_project1.py`

Now I’ll analyze the code and generate a complete and professional `README.md`.


Here’s a professionally written `README.md` for your **Linuxworld\_repo** project based on the contents of the files:

---

# 🚀 Linuxworld Project – Dockerized Python Application

This repository contains a Python-based application designed to demonstrate modular development, testing, and containerization using **Docker**. It includes a simple logic-based script, unit testing with `pytest`, and a Dockerfile to containerize the environment for seamless deployment.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

```
Linuxworld_repo/
├── Dockerfile
├── project1.py
├── test_project1.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

---

## 🧠 Features

* Simple logic-driven Python script
* Unit testing using `pytest`
* Docker container support
* Clean code organization

---

## 🐍 Requirements

The application requires the following Python packages:

```
pytest
```

Install them manually using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 📄 `project1.py`

This file contains a function `check()` that returns whether a given number is:

* "Even" or "Odd"
* "Negative" or "Positive"
* "Zero"

**Example Logic:**

```python
def check(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "Zero"
    elif n < 0:
        return "Negative"
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return "Even"
    else:
        return "Odd"
```

---

### ✅ `test_project1.py`

Includes unit tests for the `check()` function using `pytest`.

```python
from project1 import check

def test_check():
    assert check(0) == "Zero"
    assert check(-5) == "Negative"
    assert check(4) == "Even"
    assert check(3) == "Odd"
```

Run tests using:

```bash
pytest test_project1.py
```

---

### 🐳 Dockerfile

A minimal Docker container for building and running the app:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["pytest", "test_project1.py"]
```

To build and run the container:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t linuxworld-app .

# Run tests inside the container
docker run linuxworld-app
```

---

## 📦 Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dubeysatvik123/Linuxworld_repo.git
cd Linuxworld_repo
```

Run the application locally or inside Docker.
